Which learners need how much hyperparametering? all learners outpacing other categories by at least .05. 
sometimes it is the generator. need to do varience analysis?

8th lots cv & hp 7x5cv min4  32hp
kknn xgbLinear	RRF 
cubist cubist rlm gbm

9th lots hp 3cv 32hp
Rborist, pcaNNet
sparsity 0:spls	leapBackward	foba	cubist	gcvEarth	bridge

7th not much of either, crashes? 6cv 5hp
earth earth BstLm

If some generator or learner  clearly preffer an approach almost all the time write that down. ! 



If some problem learner combo then investigate further?

Same thing with asis centernscale and range 0-
Clear prefference among learners:
asis vs cns
cubist,xgbLinear,<-both quartiles not above 0,ppr, kknn, qrf
gam, bam,!!!, svmLinear2,msaenet,BstLm,gbm 
range vs cns
glm.nb!!!,nnet,avNNet,pcaNNet,!!,earth,ppr,qrnn,spikeslab,leapBackward,kknn,small advantage to range continues for most other learners
msaenet,gam!!,superpc,bam,relaxo,!,BstLm,svmLinear3,svmLinear2,xgbTree
  asis vs range
  best.asis=c("msaenet", "svmLinear2","svmLinear3", "relaxo",  "superpc", "xgbTree", "BstLm")
  need.range01=c("avNNet", "nnet", "pcaNNet",  "glm.nb", "gam" , "bam") 
end result
range: "avNNet", "nnet", "pcaNNet",  "glm.nb" ,,
asis: "svmLinear3", "relaxo",  "superpc", "xgbTree"
cns: gam, bam,!!!, svmLinear2,msaenet,BstLm, gbm 
small advantage to range over cns continues for most other learners
as well as range over asis except 8th (3cv 32hp) where it evens out.
asis over cns too

And among generators: these are only the positives. really bad preprocessor for any given generator are not included.
7th range: comp1, ifs -+ C1,ifs 1.5, ifs onC1, poly^C2,ifs smooth, axbxc^.3, asis: comp2!? ifs on random, ^.5,^2,log
8th range: bm^-2, ifs onC1, random, noise in pred, resc iso ran add,       asis: comp2, ifs, axbxc, ifs 1-1, poly^C2, comp1
9th range: poly^C2, ifs smooth, ifs onc1,ifs 1-1,axbxc                     asis:resc4poly,bm^-2,axbxc^.3,ifs 1.5
		cns:hay noise,quant, sNA,  latent, random
sum range: ifs onC1, ifs smooth	?poly^C2asis: comp2 .
no real effect except cns's common pref for critical issues. requires more study but not by me.

By most successful; all learners outpacing other categories by at least .05.

Fail rates.
By generator. Laptop slightly decreases them. Greater CV and HP exploration increases them as expected.
	C1^.5 is most affected.
By learner. A few learners preffer ASIS a few, Range 0-1. Same tablet v332 vs laptop 341. 
	Quarter perform far better with fewer CV & HP. 7 did not fail only on First(tab, 110dp 16hp) and then once.


Percent of maximum score for a task.
	By generator. C1^C2 is dramaticaly and positively affected by everything. I fear an error.
Asis improves a few more strongly than 0-1. Tablet v332 ,32bit improves performance on almost all datasets.
Greater than any other change. Again I fear an error. Higher CVHP improves all but one even if only a tiny bit on most.
Most problems benefit from 3x more data instead of a middling increase in CVHP. Except C2^-2 which just sits at the -.5 mark.
Probably an error again. I think I aught to redo the calculations on everything here.
	By learner. C1^C2 is probably skewing everything. Everything with nnet in the name requires range 0-1.
A few learners need asis. All learners preffer the tablet. WHAT. Almost all learners benefit from higher CVHP.
Some way more. A few learners benefit more from slight increase in CVHP than 3x datapoints.

# GeneratedRegMLBenchmark
Testing what the machine learning algorithms of R-caret can detect.

Warning! Installs each model's package without prompt.

Run "multiple generators" to generate data then "model tester" to see if any of caret's modeling algorithms can detect each generated pattern.
If a specific test is in "test out.csv" it will nt be run by the program. 
there are 2 additional forloops (6 extra itinerations total) besides for each model and pattern generaed. 

First two columns of test out.csv are % of RMSE generated by mean resolved by algorithm and % of MAE.

'bagEarth' Bagged MARS and 'cubist' "rule-based model tree" cover just about everything that can be covered and many things twice.
"Mean subtraction in each row" can only be covered by Simple Vector Machine svmLinear2.
 It is useful for "randomly switches between C1 & C2".
Cforest is within .05 of highest rating of "switches between 1 & -1 based on C1".

'Earth' Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline stands out but may be redundant.
 Many tree-forests of which Regularized Random Forest RRFglobal is the highest performing in terms of power.
 Finaly maybe eXtreme gradient boosting xgbLinear.

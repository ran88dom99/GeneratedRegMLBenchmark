- what if mean or median of columns differs for sparsity?  
- c1=gL1^cL1+gL2^cL2 (latent interactive features)
+? what if one is subset of another

++ or get a better center,
++ or use one to balance out the specific flaws of another
+++ re-run each isotonic regression to hopefully adjust for errors of previous.
++ isotonic regressions only. on the best for polynom transformation algorithms. probably biased?
+ what about missing values?
++ how do I combine with similar interest?
+++ 0? row column center? slightly less than that? generate random values similar to user?
+++ reiewers do not vote on things they do not like. I think this is called "survival"?
+ game centered? or absolute? or test various options like before?
+ how do I know it works? prediction again?  well yes.
+ there exist works on subject of friends to follow / journals most honest + query recommenderlab

+ c() in importance.csv or why append a vector to file seperates each scalar to a new line.
	+ ie how remove c()
+ too much unload causes crashes,
+ search generateFilterValuesData + benchmark probably on github 
- add actual correct output directly to var fil corr
 
- add hyperparamless part to cartpart.R
- does java and this ever help?
- rerun all significant differences between #9 and 8 to check for reset influence
- C2^.56 + C3^1.3 + C4^1.055 + C5 ^ 2.2
- wtf is up with detection and crashing on random?

- Random Hunt + in secong gen when random is not "random"
- Center n Scale 

+ SIMPSON'S PARADOX ++++++ well add it ok?

+ but what will be the common preprocess? cns or range?
+ reaserch mlr's preffered algorithms (km mob brnn gamboost glmnet)
- missing? maybe in mlr: dlkeras, LibSVM, generalized regression neural network and extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernels in Matlab (named grnn and elm-kernel respectively)

-how to predict with hyperopt?; train with new parameters
--+batchtools search online ;compare graphs etc.
--+just for luls a database for R
--+2d terrain map for strange interactions
-add kaggle housing

+extract 'earth' nomials
+add recc lab funksvd or netflix svd features?
+add MARS earth features 
+Can MARSEARTH deal with ifs if features to multiply against are added??? YES! its the 2  interactions limitation
++I do not need to seperate data just use this!.

+shouldn't loss cost error function depend on number of pubs reviewing a game?, so sampling based on that?
+and similarity + so an error detection system? or rather certainty prediction
+outside program to restart computer  

???+OR fast randomness test
---+and internal to keep track of fail algorithms.
---+but first! automatic yes please dl update

+SVD and RMB feature creation as in Netflix Prize
+that one mlr tester had a program on github
+mlr no hyper search if hypersearch fails

+read?write up on the type of relations the methods can detect
-+Polynoms!?! use formula interface and poly()
-+one model works when a column is over 5 points, another when under. how do I resolve that?! CUBIST
--expirament:lots of little highest R2=.75, R1=.65 but highest always split though many algorithms .4 both. conditional reaction; sometimes copies one set sometimes another
--X: if C1 low C2 represents
-can the median(with only a few columns) and mean subtraction be detected? and plain random?
--+generation model of 10 pubs 3 elements and 100 games

-probably skip this completely and just check RMSE and ME don't correct before calculating.
+Convert from quantile and range into "original"  
+Convert between 0-40 and real original and maybe 
-+the rescaling of each publication score, but if it does not help then do not bother with deviation equalization
--leave the subtraction median with MC part of the calc but MC missing, so hopeufully just using subtraction does not work.
-+test for prediction based on genera and other things that should not matter; none.both. and only other metrics.; what pub is really pointless

-move MAE before date, add MAE absolute, MAE relative 1-
-time counting for each calc

-Test all algorithms and maybe find out why some dont work(seems to be a case of too big data; need big pc?)
-was mlmetrics really a good idea? get back if predictions are very personal
-i think mean will have to be recalculated to hide target column's influence. 
-median from scratch ?

+MLR, adaptive hyperparam picking?
+perhaps i set the wrong aim? ABD test should aim for average diffferenc? that is check decomposition?
+check if quantile ever works better. actualy check if anything ever works better. only work on it if theres a chance
+split score and # of reviews off stats, to show what is clearly cause,also test decompositionability

+test how long accidental success takes.

+Test with random seed and many more crossvalidations?? on a much bigger computer.
+multistacking. (its another for loop like data representation)
++error insted of prediction for each model to stack itself?
++(picking models)
+confidence of any given prediction
++models of prediction of error rate

+Make an interface
++first pubs with similar focus
++here develop choosing number based on MAE. 
++INTERPRETABLE PREDICTION; then lowest RMSE?  or ME . but using CV or maybe testing split. CV adjusts for those rare mistakes too? Knn i think its called.

install.packages.compile.from.source: Used by install.packages(type = "both") (and indirectly update.packages) on platforms which support binary packages. Possible values are "never", "interactive" (which means ask in interactive use and "never" in batch use) and "always". The default is taken from environment variable R_COMPILE_AND_INSTALL_PACKAGES, with default "interactive" if unset. However, install.packages uses "never" unless a make program is found, consulting the environment variable MAKE.
